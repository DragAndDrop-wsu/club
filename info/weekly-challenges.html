<h2>DAD's Weekly Programming Challenges</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>
<p>A series of weekly programming challenges, designed to boost your overall skills in computer science and engineering topics. At the end of each month, DAD will pick a user to proclaim as the winner for that month. The winner is allowed to put being that month's winner on their resume (looks great under the Awards &amp; Honors section).</p>
<h4>Winner Selection</h4>
<p>Depending on the number of people participating \(\ge 3\) there will be awards for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place.</p>
<p>In order of highest to least precedence in what we look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of solutions solved, the higher the level the more weight it carries.
<ul>
<li>This ranking can be calculated through: \(4A + 2I + N\), where A are the amount of advance problems solved, I is the number of intermediate problems solved, and N is the number of novice problems solved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A functioning solution</li>
